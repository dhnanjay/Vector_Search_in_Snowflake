# Vector Search in Snowflake: A Comprehensive Guide

Welcome to this repository where we explore the intriguing world of vector search within Snowflake, a popular cloud-based data warehousing service. This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough, complete with code snippets and explanations, to demonstrate how Snowflake can be utilized as a vector database, extending its capabilities beyond traditional data warehousing.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code and explanations, please ensure you have the following prerequisites covered:

-   A Snowflake account with necessary permissions to create tables, insert data, and execute queries.
-   Python 3.8 or higher installed on your local machine.
-   Required Python libraries installed. You can install these libraries using the provided `requirements.txt` file:
   
    

-   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
